# FishFeeder
This is an interesting DIY project; a pet feeder (Including Fish) to look after your pet(s) when you're away.
This build features a web app with a warm user interface, through which the feeder can be controled from anywhere in the world. 
The web App has two funtionalities; one allows you to create a feeding schedule, and the other for instant dispensetion of feeds through a "feed now" button.

# Components for the Build
- Wemos D1 Mini V2
- TowerPro SG90 Continous Rotation 360 degree Servo
- 5V, 2A USB adapter
- Super glue (Instant adhesive)

The whole build was to be as small and compact as possible, that's why the Wemos D1 Mini is our board choise for its small size. For programming the Wemos D1 Mini, any Arduino supported IDE will do.
Any developement board with an ESP8266 would work as well. https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/d1/d1_mini.html
