# FishFeeder
This is an interesting DIY project; a pet fish feeder to look after your fish when you're away.
This build features a web app with a warm user interface, through which the feeder can be controled from anywhere
in the world. The web App allows you to create a feeding schedule for youe fish. It also has a "feed now" button, which dispences the food instantly if you so wish.


             This is a project in progress...
